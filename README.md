## Introduction

This repository contains the code and data used to perform a one-sample Student's T test to compare the mean temperature of a small sample of microchips against the population temperature. The goal of this analysis is to determine whether the temperature of the microchips significantly differs from the population mean.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following software and libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)


## Results
The analysis results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook and include the following:

- Data exploration and visualization.
- Hypothesis testing using a one-sample T test.
- Constructing the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
- Calculation of the test statistic, p-value, and confidence interval.
- Conclusion about whether the microchip temperature differs significantly from the population mean.
